#### Description: Fourth Responsive Web Design project from FreeCodeCamp: Technical Documentation Page
This project is a SQL documentation page. I chose SQL as the topic since I know it pretty well and figured that it would be an interesting subject to make documentation for. I included a navigation bar on the left with topics that can be clicked on to jump to their specific part of the page. I covered the basics of SQL and included code examples for each topic.
